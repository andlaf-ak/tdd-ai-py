# Developer Instructions

## Automated Commit Handling

When the user prompts with just "commit":
1. Check git status to see what files are staged/modified
2. Stage any unstaged changes with `git add .`
3. Generate a sensible commit message based on the changes
4. Commit with that message
5. Confirm the commit was successful

The commit message should:
- Be descriptive and concise
- Follow conventional commit format when applicable
- Describe what was changed, not just what files were touched
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

Example workflow:
- User says "commit"
- Check `git status`
- Stage changes with `git add .`
- Analyze changes to create meaningful message
- Execute `git commit -m "Meaningful message"`
- Confirm success
