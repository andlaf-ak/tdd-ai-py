## üìñ Getting Started with the Documentation

For **developers** wanting to understand or contribute to this project:

1. **Start Here**: Read the [Main README](../README.md) for complete project overview
2. **Algorithm Understanding**: Study the [Huffman Algorithm walkthrough](../README.md#how-it-works) with concrete examples
3. **Development Approach**: Review [TDD Principles](./principles/TDD_PRINCIPLES.md) to understand the methodology
4. **Python Standards**: Check [Python TDD Principles](./principles/PYTHON_TDD_PRINCIPLES.md) for implementation practices
5. **Code Quality**: See [Coding Principles](./principles/CODING_PRINCIPLES.md) for general best practices

## üí° Key Documentation Highlights

This project demonstrates:
- **Test-First Development** - Every feature built through failing tests first
- **Functional Programming** - Leveraging Python's functional capabilities efficiently
- **Performance Optimization** - Algorithm complexity analysis and practical improvements
- **AI-Human Collaboration** - Developed with Claude Code and Claude Sonnet 4
- **Production Quality** - Type hints, linting, formatting, and comprehensive testing

The documentation reflects real-world application of these principles in building a complete compression algorithm from scratch.
